        I   am  an   outgoing  and   energetic  (ask   anybody)  young
        professional,  seeking  a  career  that fits  my  professional
        skills, personality, and  murderous tendencies.  My squid-like
        head is  a masterful problem  solver and inspires fear  in who
        gaze upon it.  I can solve any problem  and kill anything what
        caused it. They say that there is something in my eyes.
